//  🏔️ MTECH Code Challenge SF7: "Persons and Students"
//  Concept: Practice creating classes, using inheritance to create subclasses, and creating initializers

//  Instructions:
//      Under each step below, write the required code.

import Foundation

//  1) Create a Person class
//      Include a name, age, weight, and favoriteColor properties
    class Person {
    var name: String
    var age: Int
    var weight: Int
    var favoriteColor: String
    
    init(name: String, age: Int, weight: Int, favoriteColor: String) {
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        self.weight = weight
        self.favoriteColor = favoriteColor
    }
}

//  2) Create a Student class
//      This class inherits from Person.
//      A student also has a currentClass, a grade, and a gpa property
class Student: Person {
    var currentClass: String
    var grade: Int
    var gpa: Double
    
    init(name: String, age: Int, weight: Int, favoriteColor: String, currentClass: String, grade: Int, gpa: Double) {
        self.currentClass = currentClass
        self.grade = grade
        self.gpa = gpa
        super.init(name: name, age: age, weight: weight, favoriteColor: favoriteColor)
    }
}
//  ⌺ Black Diamond Challenge:
//      Create a third class called Teacher.
//      Include a reasonable set of properties.
//      Write a function that can take either a student or a teacher and print their age.
